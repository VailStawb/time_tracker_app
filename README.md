# time_tracker_course_app

This is the first application made by me with a course "Flutter & Firebase: Build a Complete App for iOS & Android". 

It's a time tracker, where you can track all your working hours and sum up all money you've made from it.

The app has:

    -authentication with email, google and anonymous 
    
    -possibility to log in and log out
    
    -3 main screens: Jobs, Entries, Account
    
    -possibility to add a job and a rate per hour
    
    -possibility to add a new entry with choosen job
    
    -possibility to look at all entries on one page
    
    -possibility to look at the sum of all hours and sum of money
